# React Native: Inconsistent Third-Party Library
This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug caused by incompatibility with third-party libraries.  The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code using an outdated or inconsistent library, resulting in a runtime error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution by updating the library or finding a suitable alternative.  This example highlights the importance of using up-to-date libraries and checking for compatibility issues when integrating third-party code into React Native projects.
