To fix this, you need to identify the problematic library and take appropriate action.  Here are a few solutions:

1. **Update the library:** Check if there's a newer version available that addresses compatibility issues.  Update the library in your `package.json` and run `npm install` or `yarn install`.

2. **Find an alternative library:** If updating is not possible or doesn't resolve the issue, look for an alternative library that provides similar functionality and is compatible with your React Native setup.

3. **Check for library conflicts:** Verify if there are conflicts between the library and other dependencies.  If you find a conflict, resolve it by changing versions or finding suitable replacements.

Example using a newer, compatible library:
```javascript
import { ConsistentLibrary } from 'consistent-react-native-library';

// ...rest of the component code...
```

Remember to carefully review the documentation of the chosen library and follow its installation instructions.
